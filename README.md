  - `adaboost.ipynb`: Implementation of the AdaBoost model.
  - `data.ipynb`: Information about the dataframes and their columns.
  - `dataset_functions.py`: Utility functions for dataset handling, mainly transformations and feature engineering.
  - `feature_importance.ipynb`: Analysis of feature importance.
  - `feature_selection.ipynb`: Feature selection methods.
  - `final_predictions.ipynb`: Final model predictions.
  - `gradboost.ipynb`: Implementation of the Gradient Boosting model.
  - `knn.ipynb`: Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model.
  - `random_forest.ipynb`: Implementation of the Random Forest model.
  - `SVM.ipynb`: Implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
  - `visualization.ipynb`: Data visualization and exploratory analysis.

- **dataset/**: Contains the dataset used in the project.

- **doc/**: Includes documentation related to the project.

- `submission.csv`: The final predictions generated by the model.

## Usage
